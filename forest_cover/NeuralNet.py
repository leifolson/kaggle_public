    The NeuralNet class implements a neural network model.
    The network can have an arbitrary number of layers of a specified size.  
    An overriding goal is to provide a general implementation

import numpy as np

class NeuralNet:

    '''
    Initialize network
    layers => vector of layer dimens
    '''          
    def __init__(self,layers, epochs):
        # get inputs
        self.layers = layers
        self.epochs = epochs

        # initialize small random network weights
