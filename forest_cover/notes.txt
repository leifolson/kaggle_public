-- Notes on strategy for forest_cover task --

My plan is to implement most of the model code from scratch in order
to better learn the algorithms as opposed to just using a ML library


Data pre-processing:
    - partition training data into training/validation sets
    - normalize all features prior to variance analysis
    - Determine most variant features across samples
    - Remove invariants


Possible models:
    - multi-class logistic regression
    - clustering...we know how many clusters there should be
    - perhaps decision tree / random forest approach
